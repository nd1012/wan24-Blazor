# wan24-Blazor-Shared-Core

This library contains shared types which are used by the 
[`wan24-Blazor-Shared`](https://github.com/nd1012/wan24-Blazor) library. You 
can get it as a 
[NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/wan24-Blazor-Shared-Core/) and 
use it at the server side, for example.

**NOTE**: The `Images` class contains the SVG icons of the Bootstrap Icons 
1.11.3 package without the `bootstrap-icons.svg`.
